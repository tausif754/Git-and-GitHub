Q2. Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository
Answer
The Git workflow involves three key components: the working directory, the staging 
area, and the repository. Git is a distributed version control system that allows
 you to track changes in your codebase and collaborate with others. Let's break down
how these components interact in the Git workflow:
1.Working Directory:
The working directory is your local file system where you create, edit, and 
organize your project files. This directory contains all the files and directories of your project.

2.Staging Area (also known as the "index" or "cache"):
he staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and 
the repository. It acts as a holding area where you can select and prepare specific 
changes (or "chunks" of changes) from your working directory to be included in the next commit.

3.Repository:
The repository (or "repo") is where Git stores the full history of your project,
 including all the changes made to the files over time.
