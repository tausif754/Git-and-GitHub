Q3. Explain what .gitignore is and why itâ€™s important in version control
Answer
The .gitignore file is a configuration file used in Git to specify which files and 
directories should be ignored and not tracked by the version control system.
 It's a text file that contains a list of patterns, such as filenames or directory names, 
 that Git should exclude from being considered for commits and version control.
The patterns in a .gitignore file tell Git to disregard certain files,
 preventing them from cluttering the repository or being accidentally included in commits.

 -> Here's why the .gitignore file is important in version control:
 1.Prevents Unintended Commits: 
 2.Improves Repository Cleanliness: 
 3.Reduces Merge Conflicts:
 4.Security and Privacy:
 5.Customization:
 6.Cross-Platform Compatibility:
 -> Here's an example of a simple .gitignore file:
 # Ignore compiled files
*.class
*.o
*.pyc

# Ignore build directories
/target/
/node_modules/
/.venv/
