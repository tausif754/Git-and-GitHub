Q1. Explain what version control is and its importance in software development
Answer
-> Version control, also known as source code management (SCM) or revision control, 
 is a crucial aspect of software development that helps teams and individual developers
 track and manage changes to their codebase over time. It enables multiple people to 
 collaborate on a software project, keeps a historical record of all changes made 
 to the code, and ensures that different versions of the code are well-organized and
  easily accessible. Version control systems (VCS) are the tools and practices 
  used to implement version control.

  -> Here are some key aspects of version control and its importance in software development:
  1.History and Auditing:
  2.Collaboration:
  3.Conflict Resolution: 
  4.Reproducibility:
  5.Backup and Disaster Recovery: 
  6.Branching and Tagging:
  7.Code Review and Quality Assurance:
  8.Scalability: 

  -> There are various version control systems available, with Git being one of the most widely
used in the software development community. Git, in particular, offers distributed version
control, which allows developers to work offline and provides powerful branching and merging capabilities.
